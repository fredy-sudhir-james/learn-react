There are 2 types of exports/import

- Default export/import
	* a file can only return 1 default export
	* while importing we just have to give the export variable name

- Named export/import
	* used when there are multiple variables to export.
	* done by specifying "export" in from of the variable
	* while importing we use curly brackets {VARIABLE_NAME}
